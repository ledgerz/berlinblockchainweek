Berlin Blockchain Week: Fact Sheet
=======
## Concept:

Berlin Blockchain Week is basically completely decentralized and does not have a single owner. Every event will be in charge of whoever wants to own the organization of it.
We don’t have a budget for the webdesign, so we should think of at least crowdfunding if no organization can cover these costs.
There are no hard requirements on events, only that they are free or have a reasonable entry fee, besides a no-shilling policy (see below for more). This is what makes us special and different from other cities - we really wanna push this because we live, work and learn here.

The rest is volunteer-based, meaning:
- if we wanna make this real, we need to donate time & work.
- all events are open to contributions from all groups involved
- everyone can invite more members to help with organizing


This repo is to collect and decide on project ideas. In order to submit a proposal use the [issues on this repo](https://github.com/ledgerz/project-ideas/issues).

## Berlin Blockchain Week essentials:
All conferences/events should be free of charge or invitees should pay a reasonable fee, according to the quality of the speakers and the responsible budgeting of the event. We won’t impose an “all free” week, but please charge responsibly.

No lambos, no shilling, no marketing, pure content.
Agnosticism, open-mindedness are encouraged, actually, they are obligatory.

## Reaching out to people:
Ask in the #general slack. Even though more people are active than the others, nobody is responsible for answering questions for newcomers, so please make sure your message is in General, and not a private message. We all have opinions, and we are all in this together.

##Important:
ETHBerlin and Berlin Blockchain Week should not be confused. The ETHBerlin team depends on ETHGlobal and the organization is closed. 

Berlin Blockchain Week is a movement, and it’s fully open. Any ETHBerlin decision is separate from Berlin Blockchain Week. The only way to reach ETHBerlin is via their email, which all the organization team reads: joinus@ethberlin.com
